\title{Get priors for all parameters in the model}
\usage{
get_prior(ST, rhs_table, family, prior = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{ST}{Tibble. A segment table as returned by \code{get_segment_table}.}

\item{rhs_table}{Tibble as returned by \code{get_rhs()}.}

\item{family}{An \code{mcpfamily} object as returned by \code{mcpfamily()}.}

\item{prior}{A list of user-defined priors. Will overwrite the relevant
default priors.}
}
\value{
A named list of strings. The names correspond to the parameter names
and the strings are the JAGS code for the prior (before converting SD to
precision).
}
\description{
Starts by finding all default priors. Then replace them with user priors.
User priors for change points are truncated appropriately using
`truncate_prior_cp``, if not done manually by the user already.
